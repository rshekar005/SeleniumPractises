Upload File in Selenium Webdriver using Autoit
This guide will show you how to Upload File in Selenium Webdriver using Autoit Step by Step guide in a simple manner.

1-While automating web-application many times you will get window-based activity like- file upload, file download pop-up, window authentication for secure sites, etc. In this case, Selenium will fail and will not be able to handle desktop elements.

We can upload files in Selenium using different ways

1- Using sendKeys method

2- Using Robot class

3- Using AutoIT

4- Using WGET

Let me explain to you the easiest way which works most of the time using sendKeys

Syntax

driver.findElement(By.xpath("xpath of any element")).sendKeys("File Path");

Example

driver.findElement(By.xpath("//input[@type='file']")).sendKeys("C:\\Downloads\\Mukesh.png");

or

driver.findElement(By.xpath("//input[@type='file']")).sendKeys("C:/Downloads/Mukesh.png");

Explanation- You do not have to click on file uploader because if you click on the file upload button, it will start file uploader which you need to handle separately.

You can find the locator of the element where the file needs to be updated and then you can pass the file path directly, files can be excel, png or any type depends on your application.

Note- In case of sendKeys method does not work then you can go ahead with all other options.

 

Introduction to AutoIT tool
1-AutoIt is a freeware automation tool that can work with desktop applications too.

2-It uses a combination of keystrokes, mouse movement and window/control manipulation in order to automate tasks in a way not possible or reliable with other languages (e.g. VBScript and SendKeys).
